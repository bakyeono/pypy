TODO for the python3 test suite:

* test_decimal:
   In py3k, hash(-1) is now -2 (probably as an optimisation, because
   PyObject_Hash() return -1 on exception).
   It's important to be compatible, since other classes like Decimal
   and Fractions have to return the same hashes for equivalent values.
   IOW: int.__hash__ is part of the Python language specification.

* test_fractions
* test_numeric_tower
   float.__hash__ has changed as well.

* test_float
   nan = float('nan');  assert nan in [nan]
   This has always been true in CPython, it is now guaranteed that the
   containers use the "is" operator as an optimization.
   Difficult in pypy because optimized containers are arrays of
   unwrapped doubles. A possible solution is to special-case nan in
   FloatListStrategy.unwrap().

* test_memoryview
   Needs bytes/str changes. Probably easy.

* test_peepholer
   'a in [1,2,3]' is rewritten as 'a in (1, 2, 3)'
   and the tuple is a prebuilt constant.
   Likewise, a set becomes a frozenset.

* test_pep263
   Tracebacks should be able to print unicode source code.

* test_sqlite
   (Probably easy) Ports of CPython changeset fc6f90545cb4 and PyPy
   48d194e3ac07.

* test_sys
* test_threading:
   Missing sys.getswitchinterval().
   We would be interesting to implement the new thread switching
   logic, it's a lot of work though.
