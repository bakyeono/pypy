TODO for the python3 test suite:

* test_decimal:
   In py3k, hash(-1) is now -2 (probably as an optimisation, because
   PyObject_Hash() return -1 on exception).
   It's important to be compatible, since other classes like Decimal
   and Fractions have to return the same hashes for equivalent values.
   IOW: int.__hash__ is part of the Python language specification.
   The py3k-newhash branch has an updated float hash, int's hash is
   still pending

* test_fractions
* test_numeric_tower
   float.__hash__ has changed as well (fixed on py3k-newhash)

* test_float
   nan = float('nan');  assert nan in [nan]
   This has always been true in CPython, it is now guaranteed that the
   containers use the "is" operator as an optimization.
   Difficult in pypy because optimized containers are arrays of
   unwrapped doubles. A possible solution is to special-case nan in
   FloatListStrategy.unwrap().

* test_memoryview
   Needs bytes/str changes. Probably easy. Work for this has begun on
   py3k-memoryview (by mjacob)

* test_peepholer
   'a in [1,2,3]' is rewritten as 'a in (1, 2, 3)'
   and the tuple is a prebuilt constant.
   Likewise, a set becomes a frozenset.

* test_pep263
   Tracebacks should be able to print unicode source code. This is
   really due to the tokenizer not being fully unicode aware. The
   parser can somewhat hack around this but maybe not completely

* test_sqlite
   (Probably easy) Ports of CPython changeset fc6f90545cb4 and PyPy
   48d194e3ac07.

* test_sys
* test_threading:
   Missing sys.getswitchinterval(). https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1470
   We would be interesting to implement the new thread switching
   logic, it's a lot of work though.


own-tests:

* module/test_lib_pypy
  These crash the buildbots (via SyntaxErrors): some were really made
  to run under Python 2.x

* interpreter.test.test_zzpickle_and_slow test_pickle_frame_with_exc
  Due to W_OperationError not being pickleable. Probably be best for
  the ExceptionHandlerBlock to push *sys.exc_info() instead of it,
  like CPython does

* module.bz2.test.test_bz2_file test_open_non_existent
  Some really obscure GC stuff

* module.cpyext.test.test_structseq test_StructSeq
  structseq now subclasses tuple on py3, which breaks how
  BaseCpyTypeDescr.realize allocates it

* module.marshal.test.test_marshal
  Handling of exceptions w/ bad data? Or is the test wrong?

* objspace.std.test.test_floatobject test_from_string
  The unicode-based number parsing routines don't raise UnicodeErrors,
  but more importantly they raise unprintable exceptions


antocuni's older TODO:

run coverage against the parser/astbuilder/astcompiler: it's probably full of
dead code because the grammar changed

re-enable IntDictStrategy

re-enable StdObjSpace.listview_str

re-enable the kwargs dict strategy in dictmultiobject.py
re-enable view_as_kwargs

unskip numpypy tests in module/test_lib_pypy/numpypy/

optimize W_UnicodeObject, right now it stores both an unicode and an utf8
version of the same string

re-enable BUILD_LIST_FROM_ARG: see the comment in astcompiler/codegen.py in
ast.ListComp.build_container
