TODO for the python3 test suite:

* test_memoryview
   Needs bytes/str changes. Probably easy. Work for this has begun on
   py3k-memoryview (by mjacob) https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1542

own-tests:

* module/test_lib_pypy
  These crash the buildbots (via SyntaxErrors): others were really
  made to run under Python 2.x and so simply fail

* module.cpyext.test.test_structseq test_StructSeq
  structseq now subclasses tuple on py3, which breaks how
  BaseCpyTypeDescr.realize allocates it


antocuni's older TODO:

* run coverage against the parser/astbuilder/astcompiler: it's probably full of
dead code because the grammar changed

* re-enable strategies https://bugs.pypy.org/issue1540 :
 - re-enable IntDictStrategy
 - re-enable StdObjSpace.listview_str
 - re-enable the kwargs dict strategy in dictmultiobject.py
 - re-enable view_as_kwargs

* unskip numpypy tests in module/test_lib_pypy/numpypy/

* optimize W_UnicodeObject, right now it stores both an unicode and an utf8
version of the same string

* re-enable BUILD_LIST_FROM_ARG: see the comment in astcompiler/codegen.py in
ast.ListComp.build_container
